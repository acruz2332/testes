#all code from this repository was made about 1-6 months ago.

for KMP algorithm, i tried to implement KMP not the excellent way (since i used list accessing) but im sure its work. The algoritm was used for final project course of Algorithm Analysis and Structure Data and implemented for string matching on DNA.

gemastik_model was created for gemastik competition material. It is a model machine learning that processing text for predicting whether its depression or not with binary classification method.
test data was collected using google form, and translated it from indonesian to english, since the trained model is english based. Prediction was fit with some machine learning Algorith like SVM, descision tree, naive bayes and other.
the best accuracy was found in SVM algorithm.

i split into two files on healthkathon because google colab was crashed when i do it in one file. So, preprocessing was made in google colab then modelling and fit was made using jupynter notebook.
it was a big process, since i processing 11million data. So i'm so sorry if the structure was so bad, its contain the old process and so messy. But there is a redline when i use
random oversampling with total 1,9m data train and fit it on Random forest algorithm. It gives 92% accuracy.

##anyway, you can find out my other project on this github, thank you:D
